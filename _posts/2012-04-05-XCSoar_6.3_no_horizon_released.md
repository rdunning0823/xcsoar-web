title: XCSoar 6.3 No Horizon released!

We've released the No Horizon version of XCSoar 6.3!

This has all features of 6.3 described below by Turbo - the only difference is that the startup screen displays "Horizon: disabled" and of course the horizon feature is disabled.  This version allows competition pilots to fly with XCSoar 6.3 while complying with the US and FAI rules with respect to artificial horizons.  We recognize that the XCSoar team comprises two groups, those who want the fullest, safest product, and those who want a product to allow them to compete in soaring competitions.  We now support both groups.
